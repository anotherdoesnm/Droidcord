# Droidcord2

A reworked fork of (Droidcord)[https://github.com/leap0x7b/Droidcord] to fix it's performance issues mainly for the X10 Mini Pro


Originally started off as a fresh project, then found Droidcord later and improving that proved to be simpler, which is why it's an Ant project and not a proper fork.
